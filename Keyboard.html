			The most common types of keyboards are:
			<ul>
				<li>Pianos</li>
				<li>Electronic Keyboards or Synthesizers</li>

		<h3>
			History of Keyboards
		</h3>
		<p>
			The earliest known keyboard instrument was the Ancient Greek hydraulis, a type of pipe organ, invented in the third century BC.
			During the 14th century two types of keyboards known as the clavichord and the harpsichord appeared. They remained popular until the widespread adoption of the piano in the 18th century. The piano was revolutionary as it gave the user the ability to vary the intensity of the keys(and hence, the sound) by applying different amounts of force.
